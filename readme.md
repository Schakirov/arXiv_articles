My collection of best arXiv deep learning articles: <br/>
https://yadi.sk/d/KImhk3ccHNWycg <br/>
Most of those articles have my highlightings in them to see their thoughts fast and easy.<br/>
There are ~966 articles, divided into several topics (for more topics, see the topic named "other topics")<br/>
In every topic, there is separation into several categories like "2nd", "3rd code" etc.<br/>
"2nd" is generally better and more interesting than "3rd",  "3rd" is better than "4th" etc.<br/>
